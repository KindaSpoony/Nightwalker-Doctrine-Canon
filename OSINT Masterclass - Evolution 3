OSINT Masterclass (Evolution 3): Fusion & All-Source Integration

Situation

Modern conflicts and operations demand the seamless fusion of open-source intelligence (OSINT) with classified sources to create a comprehensive intelligence picture. Marines operating in a Joint Intelligence environment (e.g. a Marine Operations Center or Joint Task Force J2) must integrate OSINT alongside signals intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and measurements and signature intelligence (MASINT). Doctrinally, all-source intelligence involves combining information from all disciplines – for example, Joint Publication 2-0 emphasizes that analysts should “combine, compare, and analyze classified and open source material” and cross-verify information from different sources ￼. OSINT complements other intel disciplines by filling gaps and adding context, although it is susceptible to adversary deception and requires careful validation ￼. This lesson’s context spans several case studies – from counter-IED operations in Helmand (Afghanistan 2010–2013) to ISIS drone threats in Syria (2016–2020) – highlighting the need for robust fusion. For instance, at the height of ISIS’s drone campaign in 2017, the group was launching 60–100 drone attacks per month ￼, a threat volume that demanded multi-source tracking and analysis. Similarly, coalition exercises like NATO’s Trident Juncture (2018) and real-world campaigns such as Libya’s Operation Odyssey Dawn/New Dawn (2011) demonstrated that effective intelligence support relies on integrating OSINT-derived insights (e.g. social media reports, news, public sensor data) with traditional intel to inform commanders. All of this occurs under the imperative of maintaining security and ethical standards even as we leverage publicly available information.

Mission

Train intelligence analysts to effectively integrate OSINT with classified intelligence sources in support of Marine Corps and Joint operations. Analysts will learn to operate within a fusion cell environment to build a Common Intelligence Picture (CIP) that feeds the Common Operational Picture (COP), correlating OSINT indicators with kinetic activity and Priority Intelligence Requirements (PIRs). The mission of this evolution is to instill the tradecraft for all-source fusion – enabling analysts to overlay OSINT findings with SIGINT, HUMINT, GEOINT, and MASINT, prioritize efforts based on commander’s PIRs, and produce actionable, multi-intelligence assessments for decision makers. This training emphasizes doctrinal alignment (per JP 2-0, MCDP-2, etc.) and coalition sharing protocols so that our intelligence products can be readily disseminated to partners when appropriate. In summary, our mission is to produce analysts capable of fusing unclassified and classified sources into unified intelligence outputs, in order to enhance situational awareness, drive informed operations, and uphold VAULTIS principles of data management (Visible, Accessible, Understandable, Linked, Trusted, Interoperable, Secure).

Execution

Figure: Notional fusion overlay timeline. This example depicts OSINT indicators (e.g. local news reports, social media posts) aligned against other intelligence events (SIGINT intercepts, HUMINT tips, and a kinetic strike) across a timeframe. Such visual overlays help analysts see correlations in time and space between open-source cues and classified operational data.

Concept of Operations: This module employs a hybrid instructional format combining lecture, case-study analysis, and practical exercises. The Execution is structured like an operations order, detailing how analysts will implement fusion techniques. Key focus areas include: establishing a fusion cell, multi-INT correlation methods, COP/CIP visualization, PIR-driven collection, and ethical decision-making.
	•	Fusion Cell Structure & Workflow: We begin by outlining the architecture of an intelligence fusion cell. In practice, OSINT specialists are embedded alongside SIGINT, HUMINT, GEOINT, etc., in an all-source analysis team. Each discipline contributes their reports into a centralized workflow for analysis. A best practice is to designate an OSINT integrator on the team – as recent Army experiments suggest, an OSINT integrator synchronizes OSINT collection with the broader intel effort and translates PIRs into OSINT requirements ￼. Within the fusion cell, OSINT findings (e.g. a tweet about enemy movement, a news report of an explosion) are immediately shared with all-source analysts. Those analysts then corroborate the OSINT with classified streams. According to one experiment’s findings, “OSINT team outputs should feed into the fusion cell where the G-2/S-2 staff can corroborate or confirm the OSINT reports”, ensuring other staff sections (electronic warfare, cyber, info ops, etc.) also receive OSINT for cross-checking ￼. This means a report from an OSINT monitor is never viewed in isolation – it enters the fusion battle rhythm (e.g. daily intel update or targeting cycle) to be vetted alongside other intel. Fusion cell SOPs will be covered, such as daily synchronization meetings where OSINT analysts brief any significant open-source indicators and propose hypotheses that other discipline analysts can confirm or refute.
	•	Correlation of OSINT with Other INTs: Analysts will practice building correlation matrices to systematically compare indicators across sources. This technique helps to validate intelligence or flag discrepancies. For example, if OSINT yields a tip about an impending attack, analysts check SIGINT for any related communications, HUMINT for local source warnings, and GEOINT for imagery of preparations. The table below illustrates a simplified correlation matrix for different scenarios, showing how each intelligence discipline can support or challenge a given indicator:

Intelligence Indicator / PIR	OSINT (Open Source)	SIGINT (Signals)	HUMINT (Human)	GEOINT (Geospatial)
Suspected IED workshop at Grid X	Local news reports unusual nightly activity near site X	Intercepted phone chatter mentions a “workshop” at X around 02:00	Detainee tip: building at X used for bomb-making	Drone IR imagery shows heat signatures at X during nights
High-value target (HVT) spotted in Area Y	Social media photo shows militant in Area Y (date/time)	Cellphone SIGINT ping places that individual in Area Y same time	Friendly informant saw the HVT in Area Y that day	Satellite image shows convoy vehicles in Area Y that week
Rumor of enemy offensive at Location Z	Facebook rumor of large enemy force gathering (unverified)	No unusual comms detected (routine traffic only)	Trusted sources deny any build-up; report likely propaganda	No massing of forces visible in latest ISR imagery (normal patterns)

Table: Example correlation matrix cross-referencing OSINT with other intelligence sources. Analysts confirm indicators when multiple sources agree (e.g. multiple intel streams point to an IED workshop at X), or challenge them when OSINT isn’t substantiated by SIGINT/HUMINT/GEOINT (e.g. a rumored offensive at Z that other sources contradict).
By analyzing such matrices, students learn to assess source reliability and credibility of OSINT in context. We reinforce the analytic standard that each OSINT report must be evaluated for reliability just like a classified report (per Intelligence Community Directive 203). When multiple independent sources align, confidence in the intelligence increases ￼. If OSINT conflicts with classified sources, analysts investigate why – it could indicate deception or a blind spot in our collection. This multi-source corroboration is a core tradecraft skill for all-source fusion.

	•	Common Operational Picture (COP) Overlays: Trainees will learn to create and brief fusion overlays – visual products that map OSINT data against the operational environment alongside other intel. This may include time-space diagrams (like the timeline above) or geospatial maps with layered icons. For instance, during counter-IED operations in Helmand (2010–2013), an analyst might overlay OSINT reports of local insurgent meetings on a map of patrol routes and recent IED blast sites. This spatial overlay could reveal patterns (e.g. clusters of OSINT reports aligning with IED hotspots), cueing commanders to focus ISR assets or raids in those areas. Similarly, in the Syria ISIS drone threat (2016–2020) case study, we can overlay open-source social media posts about drone sightings with SIGINT detections of UAV control signals and GEOINT imagery of suspected drone launch sites. The combined overlay shows how OSINT gave early warning (locals tweeting about buzzing drones), which was then correlated with electronic emissions and drone footage to locate ISIS drone factories, enabling precision airstrikes on those sites. In the NATO Trident Juncture 2018 scenario, analysts might maintain a coalition COP overlay where OSINT (like news articles or public AIS maritime data) is fused with allied intelligence to track movements of exercise forces and any real-world crowd or media reactions. Such an overlay ensures all coalition partners have a shared situational awareness, visualizing both classified tracks and unclassified context (like civilian activity or information environment factors). Students will use GIS tools and timeline charts to practice building these products, learning to clearly annotate which source each overlay element comes from (e.g. using color codes or icons for OSINT vs SIGINT). This underscores transparency in analysis – each datum on the COP should trace back to a source type, supporting confidence levels.
	•	PIR-Driven Prioritization: A critical part of execution is teaching analysts how to prioritize OSINT collection & analysis based on Priority Intelligence Requirements. Rather than drown in the ocean of open data, effective fusion means focusing on what matters to the mission. We cover models for filtering OSINT by command PIRs and Named Areas of Interest (NAIs). For example, if a PIR is to detect IED networks, OSINT efforts prioritize monitoring local community forums, Facebook pages, and news for bomb-related chatter in key districts, rather than random global OSINT. Students will practice writing Specific Information Requirements (SIRs) for OSINT that tie to PIRs – an area the Army experiment noted was a challenge (participants initially wrote overly vague tasks like “find bad things on the internet,” highlighting the need for clear, focused OSINT requirements ￼). We will use the case studies to demonstrate prioritization in action: in Helmand, PIRs on IED makers led OSINT teams to gather atmospherics (e.g. local radio call-in shows complaining about insurgent intimidation) which gave clues to IED facilitators. In Libya 2011’s maritime-air campaign, a PIR about arms shipments crossing the Mediterranean prompted OSINT monitoring of ship registries and port social media, which tipped off coalition navies to suspicious vessel movements. These examples show OSINT acting as an “economy of force” – a concept from ATP 2-22.9 where OSINT leverages publicly available data to cover broad information needs and cue high-value collection assets ￼. By cueing classified assets (e.g. a drone or spy plane) to check something that OSINT flagged, we ensure resource-intensive systems are used efficiently. This PIR-driven model is reinforced through exercises where students must allocate limited collection assets and decide which OSINT leads merit escalation.
	•	Ethical and Operational Security (OPSEC) Considerations: Throughout the execution, ethical injects are introduced to challenge students’ decision-making. These scenario-based questions require branching choices, teaching the balance between intelligence value and ethical/security risks. For example, one inject might be: An OSINT source is a local blogger who reports on insurgent activities. Their information is valuable (it could save Marines’ lives), but if we incorporate too much detail from their posts in a classified brief, we risk exposing them as a source. Decision Point: Do you use the OSINT reporting in detail or sanitize it? If the analyst includes specific details (Option A), the outcome might be a more actionable report, but it could compromise the blogger if the adversary or even coalition partners deduce the source – this raises source protection issues. If the analyst omits or generalizes the info (Option B), the report is safer for the source but less specific (possibly a missed opportunity or requiring other collection to verify). Students must discuss and justify their choices, learning to write “tear-line” sections that convey critical info in a shareable way without endangering sources. Another scenario explores coalition friction: e.g. During a NATO operation, a U.S. intel report (SECRET//NOFORN) contradicts an ally’s OSINT-based assessment that is unclassified. The U.S. analyst cannot fully share the classified data to explain the discrepancy. What now? Analysts consider options like using a REL NATO tearline to give partial info to allies, or suggesting a joint collection effort to resolve the conflict. The branching outcomes illustrate that poor handling can erode trust (if we simply say “we can’t tell you why you’re wrong”), whereas creative fusion (Option: share a downgraded summary of the SIGINT that counters the OSINT) can address the issue while respecting classification. These ethical injects tie back to principles in doctrine (e.g., ensuring information is “Trusted, Interoperable, Secure” per VAULTIS while still being “Visible and Accessible” to partners ￼). The lesson also reinforces OPSEC for analysts themselves: when gathering OSINT (often done on the open internet), they must use approved tools and cover identities. JP 2-0 notes that OSINT requires tradecraft in research and OPSEC for internet-based activities ￼ – so we practice safe online behaviors (e.g. not revealing military affiliation on social media searches, using dedicated laptops or managed attribution systems when scouring open websites).

By the end of the Execution phase, students will have hands-on experience fusing OSINT with all-source intelligence in realistic scenarios. They will have produced example reports, overlay graphics, and correlation tables, and navigated complex situations that test their judgment. This experiential approach ensures they internalize not just the “mechanics” of integration but also the critical thinking and ethical lens required of a fusion analyst.

Admin & Logistics

Administrative and logistics considerations ensure that OSINT integration is feasible and properly managed within our intelligence infrastructure. Systems and Tools: Analysts will use both unclassified and classified systems, so a key logistic point is providing appropriate IT setup. In a secure facility, OSINT analysts typically have access to the internet on a separate workstation or network (e.g. NIPRNet or a dedicated OSINT exploitation system) alongside SIPRNet or JWICS for classified work. We will ensure that procedures are in place to bring OSINT-derived information into classified channels when needed – this involves sanitization and classification guidelines. According to the NATO OSINT Handbook, OSINT that is unclassified in origin “may become classified in relation to the commander’s intent or its association with classified information when it is rightly blended into all-source intelligence reports” ￼. In practice, this means our admin process must include marking and handling fused intelligence properly. All students are briefed on classification markings like REL (Releasable) caveats for coalition sharing. For example, a report paragraph marked (S//REL NATO) indicates it is Secret but releasable to NATO partners ￼ – we include such portion markings in our training products. We provide dissemination templates for writing intel reports with tear lines: a typical template might have a classified header (e.g. SECRET//REL NATO) and an Unclassified//FOUO tearline at the bottom that can be shared broadly. Admin instructions cover how to use the “tearline” delimiter (often a series of dashes or a specific format) to clearly segregate the shareable content. Additionally, we supply examples of Common Intelligence Picture (CIP) slides that were used in past operations. These slides show how fused intel is presented – for instance, a slide from the Libya 2011 campaign might display a map of the central Mediterranean with overlays of reconnaissance imagery (classified) alongside ship tracks from commercial AIS data (unclassified OSINT), all compiled into a single graphic for commanders. Students will have access to these examples to understand formatting and tools (like PowerPoint on SIPR, ArcGIS, or Google Earth for CIP production).

Logistics of Information Sharing: We emphasize the VAULTIS data principles in our information management. All fused intel products should be Visible and Accessible to those who need them (e.g. posting OSINT summaries on a coalition shared drive or the Intel portal), Understandable (using clear, common terminology and metadata), Linked (cross-referenced to source reports or collection requirements), Trusted (maintaining source vetting and proper classification to ensure trustworthiness), Interoperable (formatted so different national systems and databases can ingest the data), and Secure (protected from unauthorized access) ￼. To that end, the class covers using tools like NATO BICES or CENTRIXS networks for sharing intel with allies, and how to format OSINT reports so they can be integrated into databases (e.g. using proper report numbering, adhering to schema for location/time entries). Logistically, we also plan for translation support if needed – OSINT often involves foreign language material, so procedures for requesting translation or using translation tools are addressed. Finally, students are briefed on record-keeping requirements: even though OSINT is unclassified, once used in analysis it becomes part of official intel records. They must archive sources (e.g. saving web page snapshots via approved tools) in accordance with intel oversight and evidentiary standards. This administrative discipline ensures that any fused product can be audited or revisited with its source material attached, which is vital for transparency and for updating assessments as new info arrives.

Command & Signal

Command Relationships: Effective fusion of OSINT in all-source analysis requires support and direction from the command level. Commanders and the senior intelligence officers (J2/G2) must clearly articulate PIRs and ensure OSINT is woven into the intel cycle. In this training scenario, it is presumed that the Intelligence Battalion or Joint Intelligence Center leadership has established an All-Source Fusion Cell. The Fusion Cell Chief (often the senior all-source analyst or S-2/XO in charge) is responsible for integrating all disciplines – we align this role with doctrine (e.g., a MAGTF All-Source Fusion Center led by a Chief Intelligence Analyst as described in MCDP-2). It’s the command’s prerogative to assign an OSINT officer or staff NCO to that cell, as an OSINT integrator. We highlight that recent doctrine and experiments call for this position: someone who “acquires mission approval authorities [for OSINT], synchronizes OSINT collection with higher HQ, and ensures incorporation of OSINT into planning (Annexes to the OPORD)” ￼. Commanders should formally include OSINT in orders – for example, Annex B (Intelligence) of an operation order should have an Appendix for OSINT tasks, and Annex L (Information Collection) should list OSINT collection requirements alongside HUMINT, SIGINT tasks, etc. Students are shown a template of an OPORD Annex where OSINT responsibilities are delineated, underscoring that command guidance must explicitly address OSINT for it to be fully effective.

Communication (“Signal”) Plan: In the context of an intel fusion operation, the signal aspect refers to the communication channels and reporting mechanisms used to disseminate intelligence. We ensure that there is a clear reporting chain for OSINT findings. For example, if an OSINT analyst on watch uncovers a critical piece of information (say, a viral video indicating an unfolding protest or attack), they know exactly how to reach the 24/7 watch officer or Battle Captain to alert the command. Internal to the cell, we establish a battle rhythm where OSINT contributions are included in daily intel updates, targeting meetings, and situation reports. Externally, OSINT-derived intel must be communicated over appropriate nets – e.g., posting on the shared COP system or intel chat (such as on mIRC or other secure chat) so that operations and intel personnel all see it. We train analysts on which communications systems to use: for instance, if operating in a coalition environment, use secure coalition networks (like a REL NATO chat room or email list) when sharing anything above Unclassified, to avoid inadvertent disclosure on national-only channels. The command’s signal plan should also include contingencies for surge OSINT collection – for instance, if there’s a sudden crisis, the J2 might put out a fragmentary order: “All-source fusion cell to surge OSINT monitoring on XYZ topic,” and the OSINT team will pivot accordingly.

We also incorporate standardization of reporting formats as a signal issue. A consistent, structured OSINT report format (with fields for source reliability, URLs, etc.) allows easier sharing and ingestion. This aligns with efforts noted in the Army experiment, which found a need for standard OSINT message formats compatible with command-and-control systems ￼. By direction of command policy, our analysts will use a template for OSINT reports (e.g., an OSINT report might be formatted similar to an Intelligence Information Report (IIR) or spot report, but clearly tagged as OSINT). This ensures that when an OSINT report is published, it can be circulated on all the right networks and recognized by coalition partners. For coalition operations, we emphasize using releaseable classifications whenever possible – Command should encourage products to be written at the lowest classification and with tear lines so that intelligence can flow quickly to those who need it. The lesson references ODNI best practices and NATO guidelines that stress sharing “the broadest possible” intelligence with partners consistent with security ￼. Command might also designate certain intelligence as “for training/exercise use” (in scenarios like Trident Juncture) to allow freer OSINT sharing during exercises without compromising real sources.

Finally, Command & Signal covers the leadership and oversight aspect of OSINT integration. Commanders set the tone for ethical conduct – they must enforce that all intelligence, including OSINT, is collected and used in accordance with laws and rules of engagement. This includes adhering to source vetting procedures, respecting privacy and civil liberties when monitoring open sources, and following dissemination rules (e.g., no posting of intel on unsecured channels). We close the module by highlighting that a successful fusion effort is a team endeavor: Command provides clear intent and resources (like proper systems and authority to collect OSINT), and Signal/Communications provides the means to rapidly share the fused intelligence. When these align, OSINT truly becomes a force-multiplier within all-source intelligence, enabling faster and smarter decision-making in operations.

Throughout Fusion & All-Source Integration, we maintain doctrinal alignment (JP 2-0, MCDP-2, etc.) and instill the mindset that integrating OSINT is not a separate activity but a fundamental part of the intelligence cycle. By the end of this evolution, Marine and Joint intel analysts will be equipped to operate in a fusion cell, confidently correlating open-source information with classified intel to support the commander’s mission – while upholding the highest standards of security, ethics, and interoperability in intelligence operations.
