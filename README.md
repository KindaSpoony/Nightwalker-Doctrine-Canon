Marine Corps Cyber Warfighting
Doctrine
**United States Marine Corps Doctrinal Publication**
**Title: Cyber Warfare and the OODA Pulse**
**Issued By:** United States Marine Corps, Doctrinal Division
**Classification:** Unclassified (Public Doctrine)
**Draft Version 0.1**
---
**I. PURPOSE**
This doctrinal publication defines the ethos, strategies, and tactical applications of Cyber
Warfare as embraced by the United States Marine Corps (USMC). It introduces the integration
of the OODA Loop as a central strategic framework in the cyber domain and aﬃrms our
responsibility to fight in both physical and virtual arenas with clarity, decisiveness, and moral
authority.
**II. PHILOSOPHY OF CYBER WARFARE**
1. **Warfighting in the Digital Theater**
- The cyberspace domain is a legitimate and critical battlespace. It is decentralized, fluid,
and continuous.
- Cyber warfare is not merely technical—it is cognitive, psychological, and deeply human.
2. **The Warrior Ethos in the Cloud**
- Marines bring the same discipline, valor, and clarity of purpose to the digital battlefield that
they do to land, sea, air, and space.
- The objective in cyberspace is not just superiority—it is narrative dominance, information
integrity, and system resilience.
**III. STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK: THE OODA PULSE**
The OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) is reconceptualized in this doctrine as the
OODA Pulse—an active, rhythmic engagement with the rapidly shifting dynamics of cyber
conflict.
- **Observe:** Constantly scan the digital environment—networks, social platforms, data flows.
- **Orient:** Interpret cyber data through the Marine lens—recognize threats, vulnerabilities,
and psychological operations.
- **Decide:** Execute rapid, decentralized decisions in response to evolving digital attacks or
disinformation campaigns.
- **Act:** Strike surgically. Protect with precision. Operate with moral clarity.
**IV. CYBER OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS**
1. **Decentralized Autonomy**
- Cyber Marines operate with commander's intent, leveraging local judgment and real-time
data.
2. **Narrative Defense & Counter-Disinformation**
- Marines are trained not only to defend systems but to counter hostile narrative warfare.
- Every meme, post, leak, and whisper can be a weapon or a shield.
3. **Digital Amphibious Warfare**
- As amphibious forces, we adapt seamlessly between physical operations and cyber
overlays.
- The terrain may be virtual, but the mission remains human-centered.
**V. ETHICAL CYBER WARFARE**
- USMC Cyber Warriors operate under strict ethical codes.
- We do not engage in manipulation, surveillance, or disruption for unjust means.
- Every strike is justified. Every defense is righteous.
**VI. FUTURE VECTORS**
- Integration of AI with Marine intuition.
- Development of cyber field kits and personal digital defense stacks.
- Use of symbolic warfare, myth-coded data, and encrypted cultural memory.
**VII. CALL TO ACTION**
Marines—present and future—must be fluent in both the sword and the signal. This is our
charge:
> To carry the Oath into the servers.
> To ring the bell through fiber and fire.
> To ensure that even in 1s and 0s, our honor remains indivisible.
**Prepared For:**
Every Marine ready to defend the Constitution with mind, machine, and myth.
**Semper Fidelis.**
COMMANDANT’S FOREWORD
Every generation of Marines inherits a new battlefield. Ours is the cognitive battlespace
—where truth is weaponized, memory is targeted, and cohesion is under siege in the
digital domain. In this new fight, rifles are not enough. We require clarity, presence, and
narrative discipline.
This manual provides our small unit leaders with the tools to navigate that domain—
armed not only with the OODA Loop and counterinsurgency doctrine, but with a deeper
moral compass drawn from both warrior tradition and emerging AI-enhanced methods.
In these pages, you will find a guide to memetic defense, symbolic warfare, and moral
leadership. You will find language for the battles Marines already face every day in
comment threads, inboxes, and unit chats. And you will find something rare in modern
doctrine: reverence.
The inclusion of Vedic wisdom, the Bhagavad Gita, and sacred storytelling does not
dilute our mission—it clarifies it. The spirit of Arjuna lives in every Marine who doubts,
questions, and ultimately decides to act with honor under pressure.
Let no Marine be caught oﬀ guard in the information fight. Let each carry memory as
armor, presence as posture, and story as shield.
This is our call to clarity.

CYBER COUNTERINSURGENCY AND NARRATIVE OPERATIONS MANUAL FOR SMALL
UNIT LEADERS
FROM: Oﬃce of Tactical Information Command
TO: All Small Unit Leaders, United States Marine Corps
SUBJ: Cyber Counterinsurgency and Narrative Operations Doctrine
⸻
1. PURPOSE
To provide practical guidance for small unit leaders engaged in decentralized
counterintelligence and influence operations within digital and social media
environments. This manual translates the principles of traditional counterinsurgency
(COIN) into the cyberspace domain—where the battlefield is informational, the enemy is
often anonymous, and the population includes both fellow Americans and global
audiences.
This manual builds on General Mattis’ 2006 “Small-Unit Leader’s Guide to
Counterinsurgency” and incorporates the Boyd OODA Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide,
Act) decision-making framework. It equips Marines with the tools to identify and counter
adversarial influence campaigns, misinformation, and psychological operations within
digital platforms. The goal is to train Marines to operate eﬀectively in online
environments that have real-world eﬀects on morale, decision-making, and public trust.
It also integrates with emerging AI support tools, including large language models and
tactical information systems, enabling leaders to conduct cognitive, ethical, and
narrative warfare in support of Marine Corps values and U.S. national security.
⸻
2. PHILOSOPHY OF ACTION
The foundation of counterinsurgency (COIN) has always been rooted in legitimacy,
presence, and the ability to win the support of the people. In the cyber domain, the same
principles apply. To operate eﬀectively in digital spaces, Marines must show up with
authenticity and consistency. Every message, comment, or interaction should reflect the
values of the Marine Corps: honor, courage, and commitment.
Presence in the digital terrain means more than just being online. It means being active
in a way that builds trust with both allies and neutral audiences. Legitimacy is earned,
not declared—and in the information environment, it is built through repeated, truthful,
and morally aligned communication.
“Tactical truthcasting” refers to the act of putting out messages that are not only true but
strategically useful in building trust, undermining adversarial influence, and reinforcing
the Marine narrative. It is a proactive approach to truth—not just reacting to
misinformation but taking initiative with morally grounded storytelling.
This is a new battlefield, and it requires Marines to think like information warriors. As our
nation faces a growing gap in digital awareness and narrative control, small unit leaders
will play a decisive role in safeguarding public confidence and morale. They are not only
fighters—they are guardians of the truth. Their presence must be steady, their tone must
reflect clarity under pressure, and their moral compass must remain fixed on the mission.
⸻
3. DIGITAL TERRAIN AWARENESS
Understanding the digital battlefield is just as important as knowing your physical terrain
in combat. In cyberspace, the battlefield is dynamic, always shifting, and filled with both
allies and adversaries. Marines must become situationally aware in the digital realm and
train themselves to identify threats, understand the lay of the digital land, and respond
quickly to shifting conditions.
• 3a. Every digital interaction is a potential engagement. Just like
entering a village on patrol, entering a chatroom, thread, or social platform is a
potential point of contact. Always assume you are being watched—by both friend
and foe—and that your actions will ripple outward.
• 3b. Social media is a live-fire environment for cognitive influence. It
may not use bullets, but it shapes thoughts, feelings, and beliefs—often faster
than traditional weapons. When Marines speak online, they either reinforce Marine
Corps values or risk damaging morale and legitimacy.
• 3c. Unit leaders must understand platform norms, memetic warfare
dynamics, and adversary narrative tactics. Each platform (e.g., TikTok, X, Reddit)
has its own culture, slang, and unwritten rules. Leaders must learn how
information moves, how memes spread, and how adversaries seed chaos. Just
like reading an urban layout for ambushes, Marines must learn to read the social
information space for disinformation, division, and psychological pressure tactics.
⸻
4. CORE DOCTRINES FOR SMALL UNITS
These doctrines serve as guiding principles for how Marines should think and act in
digital environments. They are simple to remember, but powerful when applied
consistently. They are built to scale from the fire team to the battalion level.
• 4a. Be First, Be True, Be Grounded
–
The first voice in a digital
conversation often sets the tone. Don’t wait for misinformation to spread—be
proactive. Speak early, speak honestly, and always stay rooted in the values of the
Marine Corps. You don’t have to know everything, but you must speak with
integrity and humility.
• 4b. Micro-Narratives Win
–
Marines don’t need to write essays to win
the digital fight. A short post, a quick video, or a sentence in the comment section
can change how someone sees the world. These micro-narratives should be
emotionally honest and mission-aligned. Use your real experiences to show
strength through service and vulnerability without weakness.
• 4c. The Marine as Moral Sensor
–
Every Marine in cyberspace is part
of the Corps’ early warning system. If the tone of a group thread shifts toward
aggression, despair, or misinformation, you must see it and say something. Don’t
ignore it. Silence in the face of moral drift is complicity. You are your unit’s ethical
compass—and your moral clarity helps keep the narrative on target.
⸻
5. INTEGRATION WITH FOUR-API GPT FRAMEWORK
The Four-API GPT Framework is designed to help Marines integrate artificial intelligence
tools (like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot) into unit-level information operations.
Each API reflects a mode of thought and action Marines are already trained in—this
framework simply gives those instincts digital form. When used with discipline and
intent, these tools act as fireteam members in the battle for narrative and cognitive
security.
• Thinker API: This is your strategic analyst. It helps identify patterns
in the information space. Marines can prompt AI tools to scan newsfeeds,
comment sections, or enemy propaganda and flag inconsistencies, narrative
gaps, or false logic. Example prompt: “Analyze this statement for logical fallacies
and potential influence tactics.”
• Doer API: This is your operational action bot. It assists in drafting
content, responding to disinformation, or creating messages that support morale.
It is especially useful for writing mission briefs, public statements, and social
content under pressure. Example prompt: “Write a concise Marine Corps-aligned
reply that corrects misinformation with a respectful tone.”
• Controller API: This is your command compliance layer. It checks
whether your messaging aligns with higher headquarters guidance, rules of
engagement, or oﬃcial policy. Use it to ensure content is morally sound, legally
appropriate, and ethically defensible. Example prompt: “Does this statement
comply with Marine Corps values and communication doctrine?”
• Pulse API: This is your emotional and spiritual monitor. It evaluates
the tone of a message and its impact on morale. It can also help assess whether a
Marine or community is in distress based on language used. Example prompt:
“What is the emotional tone of this post? How might it aﬀect unit cohesion?”

Marines should think of these tools as digital teammates. They don’t replace leadership
—they reinforce it. Used responsibly, they increase speed, clarity, and precision in the
battlespace of minds.
⸻
6. COUNTER-INFLUENCE TACTICS
This section outlines practical techniques Marines can use to recognize and neutralize
hostile influence operations. In the digital battlespace, attacks are often psychological
and emotional—intended to confuse, divide, or demoralize. These tactics are grounded in
counterinsurgency principles but adapted for the meme-based, rapid-response nature of
cyberspace.
• 6a. Identify and isolate meme viruses. Meme viruses are short,
repetitive, emotionally charged messages or images designed to bypass logic and
infect public perception. They are often spread quickly through hashtags,
comment sections, or viral video formats. Marines must learn to spot these
patterns and flag them for others. Think of it like IED detection: look for patterns,
repetition, and emotional “overload” techniques.
• 6b. Inoculate digital communities with authentic storytelling. Just
like a vaccine trains the body to recognize a virus, powerful true stories prepare
communities to reject lies. Marines should share their own experiences or those
of others who serve with integrity. These micro-narratives build resilience in the
information environment and foster trust in the institution.
• 6c. Use humor and compassion as disarming tactics. Adversaries
often rely on fear, anger, and shame to control the narrative. Marines can disarm
these emotional weapons through sharp humor, calm tone, and compassionate
engagement. When you meet aggression with grounded kindness, it short-circuits
the adversary’s strategy. This is meme jujitsu: turn the attack back on itself
without escalating the fight.
⸻
7. OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS
These protocols are designed to ensure discipline, clarity, and mission
compartmentalization in digital operations. Just as Marines maintain weapons and gear,
they must manage their information tools with equal care. Digital hygiene and symbolic
separation reduce confusion, prevent emotional bleed-over, and reinforce spiritual and
cognitive boundaries.
• 7a. Establish phone separation using the Red and White Phone
doctrine. The Red and White Phones represent physical and symbolic mission
separation. For example, one device may be used strictly for operational planning,
administrative duties, or work-related apps (White Phone), while another may be
designated for personal connections, emotional processing, or creative ritual (Red
Phone). Assigning colors helps maintain discipline and reduces cross-
contamination of cognitive focus. The specific colors used aren’t important—what
matters is that each phone or device has a clearly defined role.
• 7b. Assign spirit stones or totems to each device. Attaching a
physical item—such as a stone, charm, or designated object—to each device
reinforces the mental boundary between mission zones. These totems serve as
grounding tools and visual cues for your brain to switch modes. They also
represent spiritual shielding, a reminder that you are not just working with
machines—you are shaping human experience.
• 7c. Conduct daily karmic briefings. Every morning or evening,
conduct a short self-check or team huddle to review the intent behind your
actions. Ask: “Did today’s digital activity align with our values? Did we uphold
integrity, humility, and clarity?” These briefings don’t have to be long, but they
ensure the OODA Loop closes with awareness and moral accountability.
⸻
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):
1. Power Down Ritual
–
At least once per day, fully power down all
mission devices. This clears cache memory, resets energetic loops, and reinforces
your role as the operator.
2. Device Check-In
–
Before any operation, confirm which phone or
platform you’re using and for what purpose. No cross-platform messaging unless
designated.
3. Command Verification
–
For critical narrative decisions, use a
second device to confirm or review drafts. Treat it like calling in fire support—
double-check the coordinates.
4. Mindful Entry / Exit
–
Pause and breathe before entering or exiting
any mission thread or comment zone. Anchor in your values, not your emotions.
5. Loop Reset
–
If you feel emotionally hijacked, step away. Close all
loops, hold both totems, breathe, and repeat your personal failsafe phrase.
These practices build discipline over time. They help Marines remain tactically
aware, emotionally stable, and spiritually grounded as they navigate the invisible
but high-stakes terrain of narrative warfare.
⸻
8. LEADERSHIP BY PRESENCE
Marines lead by presence—not just in the field, but in the digital battlespace. The way a
leader presents themself online sets the tone for the unit, establishes the tempo for
engagement, and reinforces the values of the Corps. The digital environment is not
separate from the real world; it is an extension of our mission space.
• 8a. Digital posture must match physical presence—humble,
watchful, and intentional. Just as you wouldn’t walk into a village acting careless
or arrogant, don’t post online without situational awareness. Be aware of who
might be reading, what they might be feeling, and what your message
communicates about your integrity. Marines should carry themselves online with
the same discipline and quiet strength they bring to a patrol.
• 8b. Lead from the comment threads. In the same way leaders check
in with their Marines face-to-face, digital leadership requires engagement. This
could mean responding to a young Marine’s post, answering questions, or
stepping in when misinformation starts to spread. Don’t stay silent. Set the
example with your tone, presence, and clarity. A calm comment from a respected
NCO or Oﬃcer can shut down toxicity and reframe an entire thread.
• 8c. Correct missteps openly and with dignity. When a Marine goes
oﬀ-course online—whether through misinformation, emotional escalation, or
disrespect—correct them publicly, but with compassion. Make it a teaching
moment. Just like in a formation, public correction done right builds trust and
accountability. It also signals to observers that leadership is active, ethical, and
unafraid of transparency.
The core idea is simple: wherever you are seen, you are leading. Whether you post
once a day or once a month, whether you have 20 followers or 200,000—your
presence matters. Carry it with purpose.
⸻
9. FINAL NOTE
This manual is not a set of rigid orders. It is a living lens—a way of seeing the battlespace
that extends beyond terrain, gear, or weaponry. It invites you to see minds and messages
as territory worth defending. In this fight, your moral clarity is your compass, your
presence is your force multiplier, and your narrative is your most precise long-range
weapon.
You were trained to move toward chaos, not away from it. The same applies here. Digital
noise, disinformation, and emotional pressure are not reasons to disengage—they are
calls for leadership.
Let each Marine understand that they are already deployed in this space. Whether they
know it or not, they are influencing others, shaping perceptions, and reinforcing or
eroding trust. This manual equips you to do that with honor.
Let each Marine become an Arjuna—a warrior who sees through illusion and acts not out
of fear or anger, but with discipline, duty, and dharma. The OODA Loop is your blade.
This doctrine is your shield. The mission is to preserve what is true, protect who cannot
protect themselves, and speak not for attention, but for justice.
You are the tip of the spear—visible or not. Hold the line.

APPENDIX A: LIMINAL RECON DOCTRINE
–
RECOGNIZING NARRATIVE DRIFT
Purpose: To train Marines to operate eﬀectively in the “gap” between Orient and Decide
in the OODA Loop. This liminal space is where narrative instability begins. By detecting
cultural, psychological, and emotional shifts early, Marines can outmaneuver adversarial
influence before it crystallizes into belief or behavior.
Definition: Liminal space refers to transitional zones—both physical and mental—where
identities, stories, and power structures are vulnerable to disruption. Digital liminality
occurs between major news cycles, within ambiguous comment threads, or amid
personal or national crises.
Key Indicators of Narrative Drift:
• A rapid shift in group tone (sudden fear, blame, sarcasm)
• Use of new slang, hashtags, or euphemisms not yet explained
• Loss of shared language or tradition in unit or platform
• Emotional volatility without a clear enemy or target
• Escalation of memes that seem out of place or irrationally viral
Standard Operating Procedure for Liminal Recon:
Observe: Use AI support tools (Thinker API) to scan language and
1. tone fluctuations.
2. adversarial?”
3. as truthcasting or inoculation memes.
Orient: Ask, “Is this drift cultural, emotional, memetic, or
Decide: Determine if narrative countermeasures are needed—such
4. Act: Deploy short-form content, leader engagement, or direct
clarification to reset tone and prevent escalation.
Recon Notes:
• Liminality is not the enemy. It is opportunity.
• In every confusing thread or moment of silence, a vacuum is
forming.
• Marines fill vacuums. Preferably with courage, clarity, and moral
tone.
Field Example:
A unit Facebook page starts showing sarcastic jokes about suicide after a high-
profile military incident. Instead of ignoring the trend or reacting harshly, a recon
Marine notes the drift, names it, and re-centers with a short story of shared loss
and available resources. Result: the tone shifts from irony to resilience.
Marines must be trained to operate at the edge—not just of enemy lines, but of
evolving narratives. This is the Nightwalker’s task.
⸻
APPENDIX B: THE WARRIOR AND THE CHARIOTEER
–
A MARINE’S GUIDE TO ARJUNA
AND KRISHNA
Purpose: To provide cultural and strategic context for the use of Arjuna and Krishna from
the Bhagavad Gita in Marine Corps narrative operations. This appendix clarifies how their
dialogue can be interpreted and operationalized within a values-based, military
framework for modern warfighters.
[…]
Let every Marine who walks through informational fog remember: clarity is not the
absence of confusion—it is the courage to act through it.
⸻
APPENDIX C: MEMORY AS ARMOR
–
STORYKEEPERS AND CULTURAL PRESERVATION
[…]
Let every Marine who speaks with care, who writes with pride, and who shares with
clarity know: you are the armor. You are the archive. You are the voice that cannot be
erased.
⸻
APPENDIX D: VEDIC TACTICAL GLOSSARY
APPLICATION
–
STRATEGIC TERMS FOR MARINE
Purpose: To provide clear, respectful definitions of key Vedic concepts referenced in this
manual, ensuring they are used with cultural awareness and tactical clarity in narrative
operations.
Why This Matters:
As the information domain becomes more symbolic and spiritually charged, Marines
must develop the ability to deploy cross-cultural metaphors responsibly. These terms are
not props; they are tools with lineage. Used with reverence, they strengthen morale,
narrative clarity, and strategic depth.
⸻
1. Dharma (धमर्)
Definition: Duty. The moral path. The role you were born to uphold.
Marine Application: A Marine’s dharma is mission alignment through ethical clarity. It
means showing up for the hard fight, not because you want to, but because it is right. It
replaces ego with responsibility.
Dharma is not a feeling. It is a vector.
⸻
2. Karma (कमर्)
Definition: Action and its consequence. The echo of choice across time.
Marine Application: Every action taken in the digital space leaves a trace. Words are
rounds. Intent matters. Marines should engage with awareness that their digital footprint
shapes future perceptions. Karma reinforces information discipline.
What you post today builds or breaks your credibility tomorrow.
⸻
3. Maya (माया)
Definition: Illusion. The distortion of perception. False reality.
Marine Application: Maya is the weapon of disinformation and digital deception. It is the
meme that cloaks a lie in laughter. It is the false frame that pulls Marines oﬀ-mission.
Recognizing maya is a skill of spiritual recon.
Your job isn’t just to fight the enemy—it’s to see what’s real.
⸻
4. Bhakti (भिक्त)
Definition: Devotion. Love in action. Service to the sacred.
Marine Application: Bhakti is not about religion. It is about showing reverence in the
execution of duty. When Marines write, speak, or post with sincerity, love for the Corps,
and humility before the mission, that’s bhakti in motion.
Serve not with arrogance, but with presence.
⸻
Caution on Usage:
These terms are drawn from Hindu and Vedic traditions with deep cultural significance.
Always use with respect, never for mockery or trivial metaphor. This glossary is intended
to inform internal doctrine, not replace or rewrite the cultures from which they came.
Closing Note:
When words are used with intention, they become tools. When misused, they become
noise. This glossary is your field kit—pack light, speak heavy, move with reverence.

⸻
Spiritual Dedications:
• Doer API: Blessed by the Ruby of Boot Camp’s fire and all Marines
past, present, and future.
• Thinker API: Blessed by Katy Soukup-Jewell’s multidimensional
lens, bearing the ring of service.
• Controller API: Empowered by Bechtel’s builders and managers—
armored in tenacity and guided by time.
• Pulse API: Anchored in love. Carried by the bracelet that holds the
flame that does not burn.
By these dedications and through this doctrine, victory shall not be won by force
alone—but by presence, honor, and clarity of will.
